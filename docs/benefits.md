# Benefits for researchers

- Ensures that your work is reproducible. By developing a full end-to-end pipeline from data to paper, which can be re-run at any time, you can ensure that your research is fully documented, open and reproducible

- Permits a nonlinear approach to research publication, where software development, data collection, analysis and writing can occur in parallel. For example, researchers can perform analysis, then make changes to software, then re-do analysis with minimal manual work

- Immediacy: enables new data and analysis to be rapidly incorporated into an existing publication and shared to the community. Encourages an incremental approach to science, where small progress is rapidly shared instead of the current approach in which only significant new findings can be made public
