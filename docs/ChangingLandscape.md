# Context: The Changing Landscape of Research

The traditional approach to undergoing research and publishing the results has changed little in the last century. Papers are still generally written to submit to an academic journal, albeit as a PDF nowadays.

But, over the past 10 years or so, the nature of research has changed:

* More data, code, and results are published openly.

* Better software tools are available. For example, CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment), modern version control tools, updated programming languages, and containerisation, to name but a few.

* Datasets and code are continually being updated.

* As a consequence, results are continually being refined and enhanced.

The model we propose here seeks to lever the advantage of the above points into the publication process. A form of "continuous publication", if you will. The idea being that updated results automatically result in an updated paper.

It is important to stress that, although the approach we propose is largely automated, there remains the need for a "human in the loop". It is up to the researcher to decide if the updated results should go into a versioned update of the paper, or are new/significnt enough to justify a completely new paper.
